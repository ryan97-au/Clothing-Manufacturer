       "<p><span class=\"positive\">You're not ready for this, believe me</span>:  I have everything to say, and I'm speechless at the same time. Yo expect everything about this movie, and everything is small expressed. This movie has plot twist, an amazing story, amazing acting (RDJ deserves every single award), visual effects, directing, and everything you want a Marvel movie or any movie to be. And obviously, tears. Tears of joy, and tears of loss. 3 Hours pass without you noticing it, it felt like 1.5 hour, max. Ladies and gentlemen, please experience this yourself. This is a good movie.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Absolute Perfection End Game ( Score 10/10 ? )</span>:  Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Perfection</span>:  Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Action,Happiness,Sadness and pure joy!</span>:  I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect \"ending\" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!</p><p><span class=\"positive\">The zenith of the MCU franchise.</span>:  I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words. I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe. But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed! Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one. It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end. Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it, there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful). If \"Return of the King\" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film. Go see it.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">The most satisfying ending, just like the Russo's said.</span>:  This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have. It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">The ending made all 22 movies worth it</span>:  If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is, The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Just wow. Best superhero movie ever</span>:  Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">OMFG! Love3000</span>:  I can't describe what kind of emotions this movie shook lose while I watched it. I haven't laughed this much in a marvel movie, not even Ragnarok, I wasn't as touched by any as by this one, the action was amazing, the story was surprising, almost nothing got left out, it's just the ending which wasn't as strong as the rest of the move, but that doesn't really matter. If I could, I'd turn around and go watch it again. 3 Hours went by like a fingersnipping by Thanos. Just amazing. And I am aware there are a tiny few bits that don't make complete sense, but that doesn't change anything about how amazed I was.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">So good</span>:  The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!</p><p><span class=\"positive\">A MASTERPIECE</span>:  Speechless, guys, speechless... Avengers Endgame, is the best movie of superheros and of the best movies in all history.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Overall an epic conclusion but inferior to Infinity War's pace and energy (SPOILER FREE)</span>:  This is probably the highest 8/10 I could give for an 8/10 movie. There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds. Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well. Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">The Perfect Finale</span>:  Avengers Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed. During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Excellence</span>:  The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Avengers Endgame is a perfect closure for 10+ years franchise of films</span>:  Although throughout the movie you kinda expect what is happening, Avengers Endgame closes out the 10+ years of MCU greatly and opens up nicely new ways for future MCU films to come, it's definitely an unforgettable experience and a must watch for every MCU Fans, Non-MCU Fans might feel lost in this one. 10/10 for MCU Fans. 7/10 for Movie buffs.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Fitting End</span>:  Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film. I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first. Here's hoping.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Polarizing... did not live up to my expectations</span>:  No spoilers. The movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for. Infinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better. Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Perfection</span>:  This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Most Beautiful Marvel Movie.</span>:  Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Simply great</span>:  Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.</p>"

       "<p><span class=\"negative\">Terrible</span>:  Maybe 1 or 2 decent scenes in the movie...even thought of walking out.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Dumb fun</span>:  I was completely and utterly convinced that this hated reboot of the beloved 2000s Del Toro films was going to be my biggest regret at the movies. Surprisingly, it wasn't. I watched Hellboy (2019) and sufficeth to say, I was very entertained. It was very flawed and extremely hasty, but I still really liked it. The story was fast paced, David Harbour was appealing and funny, the gore was awesome, and the ending was satisfying. Of course it was a really stupid movie, but it was still fun. I was expecting something so atrocious that it would make me kick my seat in anger but I didn't. I saw past most of the flaws because I was entertained by the dark, funny, testosterone filled giddiness that was Hellboy. It's not Del Toro and Perlman and for me it didn't need to be, and that's probably what pissed so many people off. Another thing, the movie was released at a very unfortunate time, right after Shazam, and right before Endgame. It was destined to be pooped on, which is too bad. If I could explain the movie in any way, it was the cinematic equivalent of eating all your favorite junk food for dinner. You know it's bad, you know you'll hate it a lot after, but it's fun while it lasted.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">If your looking for one of the worst movies ever made...</span>:  This is a fun movie I guess to admire how bad it is. Nearly everything is completely wrong about it. The editing was absolutely terrible. The acting was horrible. The writing was done by a fifth grader. First movie to ever get 1/10 from me, and the first movie I ever saw in theaters and I was on my phone the whole time. Im glad David Harbour tried, but in the end the movie was a total mess.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">All around decent</span>:  The story was good, felt like the older hellboys with the action packed monster fighter and dry humor thrown in. The main problem was the CGI. It seemed a bit off at times and some scenes didn't feel as fluid as they should have been. Overall, decent movie and worth my time to watch.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">Not good</span>:  Such a let down hellboy and hellboy 2 are awesome this is not only Shame you can not score this a zero.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">All gore no substance</span>:  The new Hellboy reboot is poor. Imagine everything that made the Guillermo del Toro Hellboy movies stand out and have all of that sucked out into a bloody gore-fest with crappy characters and everything feeling cheap as a result. You get a movie that feels like all gore no substance to it. Having gore is not necessarily a bad thing. It's the one thing this Hellboy reboot has going for it, but if you care about the plot, the characters, or the effort put into the production side of things, then it's one heck of a wreck of a movie. Hellboy himself in this version is a completely unlikable guy with pretty much no redeeming qualities to him at all. He makes bad jokes after bad jokes with not a single good quip or one-liner. He's just a total jerk with no heart and no where near as memorable as Ron Pearlman's portrayal. The other characters don't fare that much better. The pig creature is probably the overall best, but the villain is very one-dimensional as well as the other supporting characters. Everything just feels watered down. The special effects are really bad and the annoying music sprinkled throughout the movie doesn't help either. Overall, the Hellboy reboot was just lame. Like sure it was more gory and if you like to see a bloody version then you'll get that, but for me it lacked the things I liked in the previous Hellboy movies, such as the production side of things and the depth of the story and the characters. It felt like a cash grab and the company trying to bank on the name without realising what made Hellboy decent in the first place. A shame because I was kind of hoping it might have been surprisingly good, but I just ended up being annoyed by it.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Don't trust bad reviews</span>:  If u love monster films with huge battles. Hellboy is for u. It is on of those films where it ain't about the reviews. Its about having a good time. So don't let reviews decide. U decide. Use your own opinion.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">In the top 5 worst films I've ever seen.</span>:  The originals were brilliant, funny and action packed. This was just rubbish. Truly awful script, directed by a 12 year old. I felt sorry for the actors, I think they did the best they could but I honestly wanted to walk out halfway through and wished I had when it ended.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">A very good movie</span>:  The truth is a very good movie, many say it is bad but it is because they compare it with Guillermo del Toro's films but this new movie has a good story, a good plot and very bloody that the director took a risk because not many of them dare to put so many bloody scenes and the only bad thing I notice about the film was that some effects are bad means and also some performances.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Expected Nothing, movie was okay</span>:  Ok, so I went for this movie having seen the previous Hellboy films and not having read the comics. I saw the trailer, which I quite liked. While watching the movie, during sentimental scenes, I didn't feel anytiing. During the action scenes, I was not amused. During the funny scenes, I exhaled a little, sometimes. Some moments were designed to disgust the audience, and those succeeded spectacularly. The movie was badly written, the soundtrack was horribly out of place, there was little to no character development. It seems like they wanted to include a number of monsters even if there was no connection to the story. They basically stuffed as many things in the movie as they could and confused everyone, including the ones on screen. In short, I loved it. This movie was everything I figured it would be. I for one don't much care for Hellboy, so I can't speak for the fans. But if you want to watch a movie so bad that it is funny, I would totally recommend this.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">They've just ruined it</span>:  They've just ruined this amazing franchise for all the hellboy fans. This new hellboy doesnt sound, doesn't walk and doesn't look like hellboy.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">As good as the first one (or even better)</span>:  After reading all bad reviews, I expected to be disappointed, however disappointment never came, all 3 hours of it's playtime were fun, I'd say even more fun than most other CGI flicks. Movie is great, definitely more gory than the previous ones. Creatures are visually impressive. Story might not be too cohesive but that can unexpectedly become part of the fun after being tired with all the pseudo-drama in other superhero franchises. Having no soapy love story is additional plus in my book. Unless, of course, one attends all those CGI-filled movies expecting Citizen Kanes or such. All in all, a great trashy alternative to all the current mass-oriented superhero pulp.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">A great film</span>:  Wait.. why are the ratings so low? This is a great movie. Typical Hellboy action and some laughs. I loved it. Giving it a 10 to help with the ratings.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Good VFX, too gory</span>:  Just came from the theater. The movie was fun but too gory for my liking. I averted my eyes during some scenes. The acting was good as well as the special effects and visual effects. The story was a bit convoluted though. Too much going on. Giants and faeries and witches and Merlin and King Arthur and other assorted demons... I liked Ron Perlman's wise cracking better.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Maybe one for the hardcore comic book fans?</span>:  I thought this film was ok,in that a lot seemed to be happening. However I struggled to follow why things were happening. It seemed all action and little explanation. I didn't find the the Hellboy character the easiest to get along with and follow his motives and The bad guys were also not the easiest to work out. I spent a lot of the film baffled as to what was going on and not laughing at the attempts at humour. On the plus side there was a lot of action, the film moved along quickly and it was very different.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">a good watch, stylish and fast</span>:  The movie certainly deserves a 6.5 or 7, just plain entertainment. my eyes an ears were kept busy the whole time, proper use of the R rating with plenty of gorey set pieces and scenes. go in with an open mind and some THC in your brain people.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">First time in my life I fell asleep in the cinema</span>:  Please don't watch if you value life.......................</p><p><span class=\"negative\">Chaotic</span>:  My friend fell asleep during this. The writing is laughable. Bring back Ron.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">2 hours of my life am never getting back</span>:  Anyone who have this movie more than 4 stars. Please go get a life. This movie is a disgrace to original Hellboy 1&2. Unnecessarily gory and predictable action. I am writing this review as I am watching the end of this HORRIBLE MOVIE. Please save your money and time by avoiding watching this movie.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Hell of a Boy</span>:  After seeing trailer was expecting a disappointing movie but hells bells its really quite entertaining.Non stop action with plenty of gore,violence and swearing.I salute you satan child good effort.</p>"

       "<p><span class=\"neutral\">Is DC making a comeback?</span>:  I took some time getting around to this one. When the trailer first came out, I rolled my eyes and thought it was going to be a total bomb. I thought it looked like a corny joke of a movie that was marketed strictly for 10 year olds. Then the first reviews came out and the coldness of my attitude thawed out a bit. Then I had friends telling me they saw it numerous times over because of how good it was? This was the breaking point and I knew I had to see it, and all I can say is, wow, has DC hit a home run! It surprised me how well it did in the shadow of both Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame. Shazam! is brave in being both intense but great for kids, and also amazing at building its characters and getting us invested in them (I was in love with the foster parents!) Zachary Levi is pitch perfect as the naive \"boy trapped in a man's body\" superhero. The only problem I had was that it dragged on for way too long.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">GOOD JOB DC!</span>:  Shazam is the most successful DCEU movie for me. Because it gives you everything what it promises before you watch. Other movies couldn't make that. My expectations were low but I had a great time. Movie knows its limits, it brings some new stuff but it has some cliches too. It has amazing references, especially about the universe. The worst part is villain. Mark Strong is a great actor, he plays well on this but character has written so empty. His motivation is so cliche. Zachary Levi is amazing. He felt me like he is an actual child. Also I liked the kids in movie too, they played well. Shazam is a great popcorn movie and it is a good choice to see it in theatre.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Violent 2nd half at odds with 1st</span>:  The reviews that took me to watch this film praised it as funny and smart. The first half was very much this. But the film industry are beholden to intense, ultra-fast, extreme, loud, dark violence. It swamped the 2nd half and was totally at odds with the nature of the first half. That web sites reviewing this barely mention the violence presumably indicates a kind of conditioning. Gratuitous violence that adds nothing to the story is simply expected. How many times must good throw evil around or vice versa? Dozens in this film. A fun 90 minute film was bloated to 120 minutes entirely unnecessarily.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">Complete trash .....</span>:  The trailer was exciting as helll ... When we saw the movie in theater it was awful.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Great for the younger audience.</span>:  The one overriding thought I had whilst watching Shazam is that it was a film I would have loved when I was 8-14 years old. The film follows Billy (Asher Angel) who is a teenager searching for his long lost mother. He is placed with a family who look after several other children in a foster home. One of his new brothers Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) has an interest in superheroes and Billy soon unlocks his own superhero Shazam (Zachery Levi). The story lines are pretty easy to follow and the humour is very adolescent. Fairly certain we will not be seeing this movie appearing in any oscar lists next year. Having said that it's a pretty easy watch and entertaining enough. Sure it's a film which I would have adored if I were 10 years old though.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Shazam is LOVE and INSPIRATION</span>:  I saw Shazam with my mom, and it was a beautiful and exciting experience. First I want to emphasize that for the first time, in a superhero movie, we were all WOMEN at the cinema, something I never thought would happen, and I really liked it because the genre does not matter, DC always makes movies for everyone. We laugh, we were thrilled and surprised. At the end of the movie, we were still talking and commenting on this movie. David F. Sandberg made his best film, he is one of the best directors and he would love to continue directing many DC movies, Zachary Levi as Shazam is the heart of the whole movie, he was born to play Shazam, the Shazam Family loved it, Those SCENES were wonderful. And Mark Strong as Dr.Sivana EXCELLENT, a brilliant performance and one of DC's best villains. There is a scene that is the most important for Billy Batson that made me cry and reflect a lot, few times a scene reaches my heart. And seeing scenes EQUAL to the comic made me get a smile. The FINAL scene is the SURPRISE and my favorite scene of the whole movie. This is the movie that in years will be the classic that we will see every Christmas with our families and friends, the most inspiring film, with a heart and a beautiful final message. The best superhero movie and the best comedy of the year. Shazam is LOVE and INSPIRATION.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">A refreshing take for the DCEU</span>:  I went to watched Shazam a few weeks ago, expecting nothing impressive. However, I came out from the movie, quite impressed with the film. This is what DC has been missing with its recent films. Just a very simple family friendly film, Shazam is a great mix between comedy and light drama. The casts are great and they have good chemistry. I absolutely adore the boy who played Freddy. He was amazing, funny and very lovable. As for Shazam, I think that Zachary Levi did a great job, playing a kid in an adult's body. Although, there is a gap between young Billy and old Billy, it is something that can be dismissed. And I think the differences do make sense, since that's probably how I would also act, if I could suddenly turn into someone else. What I also like about Shazam is that it is something you can actually relate to. The hero, Shazam or Billy Batson is just a normal boy. He doesn't try to save the world or do anything for the greater cause, instead he just tries to protect the things he loved. In conclusion, I like this film and I think you should give it a go. It's great and it's a nice change for the DCEU.</p><p><span class=\"negative\">Not good enough</span>:  I watched Shazam 2 weeks after it came out, and I heard that it was very good. But when I watched it I was disappointed with the whole movie. It lacks so much superhero-vibes and it was very childish, which I understand since Shazam is basically a teenager but he was just acting too childish. You get a sense of \"With great power, comes great responsibility\" vibes in the movie, but at most times Billy was just fooling around which annoys me so much as it shows me how unworthy he is to possess powers. The movie may have some good laughs but overall it just wasn't a fovourite for me unfortunately.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Good</span>:  This movie does very well what it was meant to do, keep you awake whole time, not bore you, and make you laugh a lot. Because of other DC movies my expectations were low and I had no interest of watching it, but I still did it and I'm glad. I loved the movie, and a cast is great. Don't pay attention to negative reviews, just go and see it by yourself, surely you will have fun, because it's HILARIOUS!</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Really enjoyable</span>:  I have to say the last time I enjoyed a DC movie was when Wonder Woman came out. Zachary Levi was fantastic in this and it was hilarious. I enjoyed the action sequences and I hope they come out with a sequel to this. I would be willing to see this a second time in the theater I enjoyed it that much.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">A Good Time</span>:  Shazam is much different from the other DCEU movies. While some of the others gave themselves a much darker tone, this one is content to be a much lighter movie, telling a coming of age story. It focuses on Billy Batson, a foster kid who's gone between various homes while searching for his real family. He forms a bond with Freddy, another kid in the home, who's obsessed with superheroes. Billy is summoned by the wizard Shazam to take his place and prevent Dr. Sivana from claiming his powers. It's not a particularly original premise, but it succeeds because of the characters, which are the movie's best strength.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Fun! Fun!!</span>:  Way better than I expected. Excellent story, great casting a lot of twists and turns. Highly recommend this production.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Great Superhero Romp</span>:  It's clear someone took notes from the Deadpool snark catalog, but that's ok. It works! Having been an every Saturday morning devotee of the Shazam/Isis hour in my youth, I looked forward to this movie with no more tree hope than just hoping they didn't screw it up. Zack Levi brings a flawed breath of fresh air to Captain Marvel, I mean Shazam of course. His portrayal was unique, entertaining, & did a great job of portraying a teenage boy in an adult male body. The results were hilarious at times, touching & endearing at others, just plain fun from start to finish. Speaking of Isis & sequels...</p><p><span class=\"positive\">No1 Shazam</span>:  Great movie with great storyline. And great family. VFX so cool. It was better than all part of Deadpool because Deadpool not good for family member but Shazam movie is good for family member with pure jokes comedy not adult bad jokes like Deadpool . so I will choose Shazam was awesome.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Come Ready To Laugh</span>:  I gave this a seven because of the comedy aspect of the film. Overall the story was kind of weak and the ending was poor. The film could have been about 20 minutes shorter. Overall I was entertained and that's why we go to movies anyway.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">Would Have Been A 10 Seven Years Ago</span>:  It's another decent origin story in an era of great origin stories. This would have blown me away of I hadn't seen a dozen others like it over the last 7 years. I think I've officoally had it with superhero movies. If you're still into them you'll like it okay.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">A high point for the DCEU</span>:  Shazam is a good film. It is not at the pinnacle of superhero movies but it does set a benchmark for DC moving forward. From the start this movie is entertaining with Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer carrying the movie with great and comedic performances. The best parts of the movie include Zachary Levi as Shazam, the script and comedic points in the movie. The worst parts consist of a lackluster villain. 7/10 from me.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Better than Potter's dementors</span>:  Excellent entertainment abut scary for my 11yr old son. Shazam is a rounded story, well played with good music. The scene, however where billy finds his mom might have been left on the cutting floor. While it explains what happened after he as a toddler follows the compass ball that his mom 'won' at the fair and apparently he becomes an orphan , I did not really miss that part until it came up in the film. The film is not over until it's really over. Wait and watch the goldfish scene, after the end credits.</p><p><span class=\"neutral\">One of the better superhero movies</span>:  Shazam is a funny movie and is probably one of the better superhero movie. The Movie is about a 14 year old boy that is a foster child and he keeps on running away from his homes to look for his long lost mother. In his latest foster home he meets his new family they seem quite nice but he still wants to run away again. Till one night he gets chosen by a wizard to take his throne and rule the world with his powers. He can always activate those by saying Shazam. I find this movie very funny and entertaining. Its jokes and punchlines are perfectly added in. The only downside is it doesn't have the greatest acting, this is mainly because most the actors are really young and will mostly improve over there acting carrias. I really enjoyed this movie.</p><p><span class=\"positive\">Stealing some of Marvel's Thunder?</span>:  Shazam is a fun character, that I never thought I'd see on the big screen. You'd expect someone who is mega buff, but instead we get Zachery Levi...and he's perfect! He brings the humor that DC movies needed. The villain isn't great, but the story behind him is pretty good. I saw lots of references to other characters, some of which paid off later and probably will in future movies. I also saw a name in the credits that didn't show up and has me excited for a sequel. (Dwayne Johnson, look it up) Overall, DC is doing a better job with their properties which has me excited, but I'm afraid also with the actors being switched out on Batman and Superman.. but this movie is a step in the right direction.</p>"

    "Threats:\n",
    "  * Few positive reviews of movies on Twitter may lead to low sales of jackets\n",
